How to bypass the broken dev mode, the semi easy way posted to xlink kai forum by crunchbite

Requirements:
-Knowledge of how to make a skin
-Winrar (preferably) or some zip archiver

Note: This tutorial was made for windows xp! your folder's might be different

1. Goto C:\Documents and Settings\your_user_name\Application Data\XLink Kai\
2. Create a folder called skins
3. Inside that folder make a folder that is the name of your skin. Ex. myskinname
4. Place your skin's files in there! Your folder path should now be: C:\Documents and Settings\your_user_name\Application Data\XLink Kai\skins\myskinname\
5. Go back to C:\Documents and Settings\your_user_name\Application Data\XLink Kai\
6. Right click on the skins folder and create a zip archive using NORMAL compression. Make sure you name it EXACTLY the same as your skin's folder Ex. myskinname.zip
7. Right click on this newly created zip file and goto properties.
8. Set the file to read only so kai can't delete it.
9. Startup kai
10. Type: /skin myskinname
11. And *POOF* your skin should be applied! Razz

So... how do I make changes to the skin after it's zipped?
1. Delete the current .zip file
2. Repeat steps 2 through 11 above.

Enjoy skinning again
